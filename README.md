This is a blockchain game!

It is a simple matching game that randomly places hidden tokens in the screen. When the user finds a match, they are able to keep the token and  make a transaction with metamask to do so. 

The token is forever kept in the user's wallet. This project was built with simple solidity, knowledge of the blockchain, as well as javascript and react for the frontend and to have a version of hte contracts.

Hope you enjoy!
